## Verb lexicons

Let's examine an example verb `nigii-waabamaabaniig` which corresponds to the analysis `PVTense/gii+waabam+VTA+Ind+Pos+Prt+1SgSubj+3PlProxObj`. This form is a result of a morphophonological intermediate representation from the lexicon: `ni<<gii<T>-<<waabam>>aabaniig` which together with phonological rules gives the correct surface form (in this case, the rules simply delete the boundary markers `<<` and `>>` as well as delete the tense-rule trigger `<T>`).

The flowchart below illustrates how the analysis and morphophonological form are represented in the Ojibwe lexc lexicon:
