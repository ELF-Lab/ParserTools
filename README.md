# ParserTools

This is the respository for the collaboration between UBC, UAlberta, UMN, and CultureFoundry on building a parser/generator for Odawa and Southwestern Ojibwe. It houses some auxiliary tools that are seaprate from the GiellaLT infrastructure such as scripts for generating yaml files from spreadsheets.
