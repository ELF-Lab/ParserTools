! The Ojibwe analyzer marks "non-standard" forms using the tag
! +Alt. These are forms which are rare in Border Lakes but occur in
! other Ojibwe dialects.
!
! +Alt tags need to be erased from analyses before OPD tests because
! they are not present in the yaml test-files crawled from OPD. This
! script does just that using a replace rule.

load ojibwe.fomabin
define Lexicon ;

define AltRule "+Alt" -> 0 ;
