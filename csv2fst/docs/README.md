## A bit of terminology

Morphological FST analyzers translate an input **word form** like *walked* into an **analysis** like =walk+V+Past=. 

The word form *walked* can be split into two *morphemes*: 

* The **stem** *walk* and
* the **affix** *ed*.

The stem is the **unchanging** part of all inflected forms of *walk*, namely, *walk*., *walks*, *walking*, *walked*. The set of all inflected forms of *walk* is called the *lexeme* /walk/. The lexeme is denoted using one of the inflected forms of *walk*. In the case of English verbs, this is the infinitive form.   

Inflectional affixes that occur before the stem are called **prefixes**, affixes that occur after the stem are called **suffixes**.

## Ojibwe verbs

Ojibwe verbforms can be split into three segments:

1. Prefix
2. Stem
3. Suffix

The following example illustrates this division:

### The verb prefix

The prefix can consist of several elements falling into two categories. The prefix can start with a person prefix which can be followed by one or more preverbs. One or both of these can also be missing.

#### Person prefix

The person prefix marks subject. It is exclusively present in the independent order (see below) and only for the VAIO, VTI and VTA paradigms (see below) which take both a subject and an object. In the illustration above, the verb prefix contains the person prefix *ni* and a preverb *gii-*

Preverbs are marked by a preverb tag like *PVTense/gii+* in the verb analysis. 

### The verb stem

### The verb suffix
